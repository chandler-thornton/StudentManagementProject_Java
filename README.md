## Student Management System

This is a Java application that I am currently working on which functions as a student management system that performs all of the basic tasks a school admin / student may need to do including:
- Adding and removing students
- Collecting information from each student such as name and grade level and assigning them a unique student ID
- Allow students to enroll and drop classes, which will affect their tuition
- Allow student to view and pay tuition
- Etc.

In the future I plan on using this project to better my understanding of technologies such as **Swing GUI** and **MySQL**.

(For complexity's sake, MySQL schema / setup will be left out of repository)
